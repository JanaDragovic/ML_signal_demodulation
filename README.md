# Demodulation of QPSK signals in the case of channels with AWGN, phase synchronization errors and time synchronization errors - Application of machine learning techniques: Na√Øve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

Using the simulation model developed in the Python, an analysis of the QPSK signal demodulation process is performed in the case of channels with AWGN, time synchronization errors and phase synchronization errors of the locally generated carrier.
